**The Gateway Protocol aims to be the singular protocol for all of humanityâ€™s most valuable data. The protocol will democratize and untether all data across the web, revolutionizing how information is processed and used.**

## The Gateway Data Lake

One of the core functions of the protocol is enabling storage and access of any information from anywhere on the web. This transforms the entire internet into a vast, interoperable data lake.

> This global data lake forms the foundation upon which different parties can utilize and compute over distributed, sensitive data.

## Private Compute And The Gateway Virtual Machine

At the heart of the Gateway ecosystem lies the Gateway Virtual Machine ("GVM"), a Turing-complete virtual machine designed to execute arbitrary functions over any set of private "packet(s)" of data stored in the Gateway Data Lake.

> This approach decouples data from traditional location constraints and trust requirements, allowing for secure, trustless computation _anywhere_.
