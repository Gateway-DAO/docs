**Gateway is building a private data layer with encrypted decentralized storage and native access control capabilities.** By giving sovereignty to users to share their data with requesting parties, Gateway opens new access to private data that was previously inaccessible by blockchain networks, companies, LLMs, and various other stakeholders on the internet.

Our mission is to turn **users into their own database** - where other parties can store information and they can control access to who gets to use it and for what reasons.
