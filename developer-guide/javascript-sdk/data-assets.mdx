## Working with Data Assets

The SDK supports two types of data assets:

1. **Structured Data Assets:** JSON-like data that follows a predefined data model
2. **Non-Structured Data Assets:** File-based data like documents, images, etc.

### Working with Structured Data

Structured data assets are useful when you need to store and share structured information like user profiles, credentials, or any JSON-compatible data that follows a specific format (that we call data models).

```typescript
// First, verify your identity
const account = await gateway.account.getMe();
console.log(`Connected as: ${account.username} (${account.did})`);

// Create a structured data asset
const profileData = {
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
  department: "Engineering",
  skills: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "React"],
  joinDate: "2024-01-15",
};

const assetId = await gateway.dataAsset.createStructured({
  name: "Employee Profile",
  data_model_id: 123456789, // Reference to a pre-defined data model
  tags: ["employee", "profile"],
  claim: profileData,
  acl: [
    {
      address: "recipient-did", // The DID of the user who will have access
      roles: [AccessLevel.VIEW, AccessLevel.SHARE],
    },
  ],
});

console.log("Created profile with ID:", assetId);

// Verify the asset was created
const createdAssets = await gateway.dataAsset.getCreatedByMe();
const assetExists = createdAssets.data.some((asset) => asset.id === assetId);
console.log("Asset creation verified:", assetExists);
```

### Working with Files

For non-structured data like documents or media files, use the non-structured data asset APIs:

```typescript
// You can create a file locally or also read a file from you file system using "fs"
const fileContent = new Blob(
  [
    "Annual performance review for Jane Doe\n" +
      "Period: 2024 Q1\n" +
      "Rating: Excellent",
  ],
  {
    type: "text/plain",
  }
);

// Upload and share the file
const fileAssetId = await gateway.dataAsset.createNonStructured(
  "performance_review_2024_q1.txt",
  fileContent,
  {
    address: "recipient-did",
    roles: [AccessLevel.VIEW], // Recipient can view but not share
  }
);

console.log("Created file asset with ID:", fileAssetId);
```

### Retrieving Data Assets

The SDK provides several methods to retrieve and manage your data assets:

```typescript
// Get all assets shared with you
const receivedAssets = await gateway.dataAsset.getReceivedToMe();
console.log("Received assets:", receivedAssets.data);

// Get details of a specific asset
const assetDetails = await gateway.dataAsset.getDetail(assetId);
console.log("Asset details:", assetDetails);

// Download and read asset content
const data = await gateway.dataAsset.download(assetId);
const content = await data.file.text();
console.log("Asset content:", content);
```
