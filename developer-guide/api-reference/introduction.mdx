The Gateway Protocol API gives you the access to all the things you can do with the PDA. You can fetch the data models which are already there, create orgs, issue PDAs, create data request models and so on.

The endpoint for the Gateway Protocol API is

`https://sandbox.protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql`.

The API is a GraphQL API and you can use any GraphQL client to interact with it.
We recommend using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for interacting with the API.
