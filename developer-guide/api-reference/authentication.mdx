Follow the steps below to get started with the Gateway Protocol API. The steps will guide you on how to get your API Key and Bearer Token to authenticate.

Steps:

1. Go to [Gateway Protocol Login](https://mygateway.xyz/login) and sign up using your email/wallet. You will need to create an Organization for the Testnet Environment. No need to create an organization for the Sandbox Environment.
2. Once you are logged in, you will see [Developer Access](https://mygateway.xyz/dashboard/user/developer-access) tab on the left side.
3. Your API key and Authentication token will be available there.

| Environment      | Testnet                                | Sandbox                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| API Endpoint URL | https://protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql | https://sandbox.protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql |
| Dashboard URL    | https://mygateway.xyz/dashboard/       | https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/dashboard/       |
| Explorer URL     | https://mygateway.xyz/explorer         | https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/explorer         |

<Note>
  If you are planning to use the **Testnet Environment**, you will have to
  **Create an Organization** on the [Gateway
  Dashboard](https://mygateway.xyz/dashboard/) and then you would be able to get
  Developer Access to the Testnet Environment.

For creating an orgnaization click on your profile icon on the bottom left corner and then click on "Create Organization". Fill the details and click on "Create Organization".

After creating the organization, click on the organization name and then click on "Developer Access" and you will be able to find your API Key and Bearer Token.

<Note>
  If you are planning to use the **Sandbox Environment**, you just need to
  create your account on the [Gateway
  Dashboard](https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/dashboard/) and then you would be
  able to get Developer Access to the Sandbox Environment.
