You will just need to create a Gateway ID in order to get API access. (This is a sandbox environment, so you can use any email address to sign up.)

Steps:

1. Go to [Gateway Protocol Login](https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/login) and sign up using your email/wallet.
2. Once you are logged in, you will see [Developer Access](https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/dashboard/user/developer-access) tab on the left side.
3. Your API key and Authentication token will be available there.
