You can change the role of a member in an organization using the `changeMemberRole` mutation. You can specify the `organization`, `user`, and the new `role` of the organization and user respectively.

The organization can be identified by one of the following:

- `ORG_ID`

The user can be identified by one of the following:

- `GATEWAY_ID`
- `EMAIL`
- `EVM`
- `SOLANA`
- `POKT`
- `USER_ID`

```graphql
mutation changeMemberRole {
  changeMemberRole(
    input: {
      organization: { type: GATEWAY_ID, value: "YOUR_ORG_GATEWAY_ID" }
      user: { type: GATEWAY_ID, value: "USER_GATEWAY_ID" }
      role: Owner
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```
