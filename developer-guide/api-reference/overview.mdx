---

The Resources section provides detailed information about the various API endpoints and mutations that you can use to interact with the Gateway Protocol.

Here are some things you need to know before you start using the API:

- All the data that you would be storing on the Gateway Protocol is stored as Personal Data Assets(PDAs).
- The data is encrypted as soon as the data asset is issued. Encryption part of the creation process. At all times, the data is fully encrypted. Only the data owner can decrypt the data which is a process that happens entirely on the client-side.
- You need to have a Data Model in place before you start using the API. The Data Model is a schema that defines the structure of the data that you would be storing on the Gateway Protocol.
- You can either choose from the [pre-defined data models](https://mygateway.xyz/explorer/data-models) or [create your own custom data model](/developer-guide/api-reference/data-models/create-data-model).
- Once you have the Data Model in place, you can start [creating data assets](/developer-guide/api-reference/pda/create-pda) using the API.
- There are more endpoints available for more features such as querying data assets, updating data assets and more.
- Once data assets are issued to your users, you can start interacting with the data assets using the API for requesting data, updating data, and more.

If you are looking for inspiration to build your application, you can check out the [use cases](/usecases/) section to see how you can use the Gateway Protocol.
