In this JavaScript quickstart we will learn how to:

- Install the Gateway SDK
- Creating a Gateway Client
- Interacting with the Protocol for various operations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install @gateway-dao/sdk">

First begin by installing the `@gateway-dao/sdk` package.

<CodeGroup>

```bash bun
bun add @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash npm
npm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Setup the Gateway Client" >

You will need an API Key and Bearer token to authenticate with the Gateway Protocol.
You can obtain these from the [Gateway Dashboard](https://mygateway.xyz/dashboard/).

| Environment      | Testnet                                | Sandbox                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| API Endpoint URL | https://protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql | https://sandbox.protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql |
| Dashboard URL    | https://mygateway.xyz/dashboard/       | https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/dashboard/       |
| Explorer URL     | https://mygateway.xyz/explorer         | https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/explorer         |

<Note>
  If you are planning to use the **Testnet Environment**, you will have to
  **Create an Organization** on the [Gateway
  Dashboard](https://mygateway.xyz/dashboard/) and then you would be able to get
  Developer Access to the Testnet Environment.

For creating an orgnaization click on your profile icon on the bottom left corner and then click on "Create Organization". Fill the details and click on "Create Organization".

After creating the organization, click on the organization name and then click on "Developer Access" and you will be able to find your API Key and Bearer Token.

</Note>

<Note>
  If you are planning to use the **Sandbox Environment**, you just need to
  create your account on the [Gateway
  Dashboard](https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/dashboard/) and then you would be
  able to get Developer Access to the Sandbox Environment.
</Note>

To setup the gateway client we will authenticate with a bearer-token and a Api key as follows:

```ts Node.js
import { Gateway } from "@gateway-dao/sdk";

const gateway = new Gateway({
  apiKey: "your-api-key", // Replace with your API Key
  token: "your-token", // Replace with your Bearer Token
  url: "https://protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql",
  // this is for the testnet environment
});
```

<Warning>
  Make sure you add token without "Bearer" word as we add Bearer automatically
  when you make request. Else it will give you Unauthorized error even if your
  token is correct.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Do not share your authentication token with people you donâ€™t trust. This gives
  the user control over your account and they will be able to manage PDAs (and
  more) with it. Use environment variables to keep it safe.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Interacting with the Gateway Protocol" >

Now that we have setup the Gateway Client, we can interact with the Gateway Protocol for various operations.

## Create a PDA

```ts Node.js
import { Gateway, UserIdentifierType } from "@gateway-dao/sdk";

const gateway = new Gateway({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  token: "your-token",
  url: "https://protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    let obj = {
      dataModelId: "uuid-here",
      description: "test",
      title: "test",
      claim: {
        gatewayUse: "test",
      },
      owner: {
        type: UserIdentifierType.GATEWAY_ID,
        value: "test",
      },
    };
    const { createPDA } = await gateway.pda.createPDA(obj);
    console.log(createPDA);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error); // Can log it for debugging
  }
}

main();
```

</Step>

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first PDA and Data Request Template using the Gateway Protocol SDK.
