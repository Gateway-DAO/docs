title: "Data Proofs"
---

Since PDAs are private by default, that data cannot be accessed directly by a third party. To facilitate data exchange in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, Data Proofs are used to send data to users and businesses looking to leverage that information.

Oftentimes, Data Proofs are the results of a Data Request by a Requestor but does not necessarily have to be.

<Note>
  Remember: Data Proofs are static information pieces about 1 or more PDAs that
  the owner holds.

### Parties Involved

The two parties involved in this transaction include the owner and the verifier.

The Owner is giving explicit permission to the Verifier to access the information they hold.

This interaction does not require issuer consent.

Consent Management
To ensure compliance with GDPR and other leading privacy regulations, for Data Proof to be conditioned, there must be explicit consent from the owner for the verifier to access the data.

Gateway Protocol records this consent as a transaction on Arweave, so it is permanently verifiable.

The consent is given as a non-reputable cryptographic signature generated by the userâ€™s wallet. This consent, along with the request ID, is recorded on Arweave to create permanence and easy reference for the verifier and owner to check against the consent given at any point.
