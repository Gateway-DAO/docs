## What is a PDA?

Personal Data Assets (PDAs) serve as the foundational assets of Gateway, functioning as secure, encrypted containers that transport your data across the web. You maintain authoritative control, granting consent for data access to selected parties (more on this in Data Proofs).

Data Contributors neatly encapsulate your information in these PDAs using a user-friendly JSON format.
