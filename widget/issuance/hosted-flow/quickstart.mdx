<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize your Gateway ID">
  
  Make sure you have created an account using the [dashboard](sandbox.mygateway.xyz). 

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Organization">
    If you are on testnet, you can create an organization automatically via the dashboard. 
    
    If you are on mainnet, you can request for an organization [here](https://mygateway.typeform.com/to/hFDhPYyZ).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Widget Key">
    Find the Widget Key underneath the "Developer Access" section of the Dashboard. Reference images below.

    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find/Create a Schema">
  Find a schema that is applicable for the data you want to contribute. You can discover existing schemas using the [Gateway Explorer](https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/explorer). If you are playing around, you can use **1c2c98e4-5cbd-40db-b441-5f6c00dedeb5** to understand how it works! 

  <Warning>This ID is for the sandbox/testnet environment.</Warning>


  To create your own schema, follow the instructions [here]().
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define API Call Body">

Now you can insert the above information into the API call body found below:

 ```javascript
const session = JSON.stringify({
  key: "YOUR-WIDGET-KEY",
  issuer: "YOUR-GATEWAY-ID",
  owner: "CUSTOMER-EMAIL-OR-WALLET",
  dataModel: "YOUR-DATA-MODEL-ID",
  callbackUrl: "YOUR-SUCCESS-URL",
  claim: {
    /*OBJECT WITH DATA*/
  }
});
```
<Tip>Claim fields are in JSON format. For example, a string would be "teststring": "value". </Tip>

  </Step>

<Step title="Call the API">
Generate a session for the user based on the parameters you have passed. 
  ```javascript
async function generateSession() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    "https://widget.mygateway.xyz/api/issue/generate-session",
    session,
  );
  window.location.href = response.data.session.url
}

const generateButton = document.getElementById("generateSession");

generateButton.addEventListener("click", generateSession);
```
<Info>Utilizing a button on the front end is optional, the URL for a user can be passed in other methods. However, having a button is recommended in most cases.</Info>


  </Step>

<Step title="Get the link from the response and send to user">
The response that you should receive is something like this: 

```javascript
{
    "session": {
        "url": "https://widget.mygateway.xyz/issue/cc348d85-c723-4183-b174-8424793d481f"
    }
}
```
You can now pass this to the user to complete.
