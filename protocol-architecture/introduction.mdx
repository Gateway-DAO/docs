## Introduction to Gateway's Decentralized Architecture

At Gateway Protocol, we have developed an innovative decentralized system architecture that empowers users with control over their private data storage and provides granular access control.

Our approach combines well-established consensus mechanisms, such as Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Capacity (PoC), and Proof of Storage (PoS) challenge strategies.

This robust framework ensures that the origin and integrity of sensitive data stored in off-chain Encrypted Data Vaults (EDVs) are carefully recorded and maintained. Gateway Protocol's unique design leverages advanced technologies and processes, including:

- Proxy re-encryption: A technique that allows secure sharing of encrypted data without disclosing the original encryption keys
- Data assurance commitments (DACs): Pledges made by storage providers to guarantee data availability and integrity

These components work together seamlessly to deliver a secure, efficient, and scalable solution for managing personal data assets.

With Gateway Protocol, users can have confidence that their data is protected and remains under their control.
