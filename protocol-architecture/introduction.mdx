**Introduction to Gateway's Decentralized Architecture**

At Gateway Protocol, we have pioneered a novel decentralized system architecture that empowers users with private data storage and granular access control. Our innovative approach seamlessly combines proven consensus mechanisms, including Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Capacity (PoC), and Proof of Storage (PoS) challenge strategies.

This robust framework ensures the provenance and integrity of sensitive data stored in off-chain Encrypted Data Vaults (EDVs) are meticulously recorded. Gateway Protocol's unique design leverages cutting-edge technologies and processes such as sharders, proxy re-encryption, and data assurance commitments (DACs) to deliver a secure, efficient, and scalable solution for managing personal data assets.
