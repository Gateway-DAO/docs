## Proxy Re-Encryption

Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) allows secure data sharing without trusting the storage provider. The data owner encrypts the data with their private key and derives a re-encryption key for the receiver. The storage provider can re-encrypt the data for the receiver without decrypting it.

## Access Control Permissions

1. Verifier requests data access from Owner.
2. Owner encrypts data $D$ with symmetric key $k$ and encrypts $k$ with their private key $sk_O$.
3. Owner generates re-encryption keys $rk_{O \rightarrow V}$ for each EDV and uploads encrypted data and keys.
4. Verifier requests re-encrypted key $E'(k)$ from an $EDV$ and decrypts it to obtain $k$.
5. Verifier requests encrypted data $E(D)$ from the $EDV$ and decrypts it using $k$.

## Revoke Access to Data

1. $Owner$ initiates revocation and signs the request.
2. Signed request is submitted to validators for verification and consensus.
3. Validators instruct EDVs to delete or disable re-encryption keys.
4. The ledger is updated to reflect the revocation.

This process ensures secure data sharing and controlled access revocation while maintaining data privacy and integrity.
