TODO - check with Nuno if any of this is valid anymore?

In the ecosystem of the Gateway Protocol, 'users' typically refer to individual participants who interact with the system. These users form the elemental building blocks of the network, most commonly serving as the owners of Data Assets. However, their roles can be versatile, extending to functions such as issuers and verifiers within the protocol.

As a user, Gateway ID enables you to consolidate multiple digital identifiers into a single, cohesive identity, streamlining your digital footprint and amplifying your control over various platforms and interactions.

The digital identifiers you associate with your Gateway ID function as 'reception channels' for Data Assets. For example, if you've linked the email address sanket@email.com to your Gateway ID, any Data Asset sent to that email will automatically be routed to your central Gateway ID. Refer to the diagram below for a visual representation of how a typical issuance process may unfold.

Beyond serving as Data Asset reception channels, these digital identifiers also streamline your access to Gateway ID. You can effortlessly authenticate yourself using any of the linked accounts, instantly granting you entry into your unified Gateway ID environment.

## Available Digital Identifiers

This is the current list of digital identifiers you can add to your GatewayID. This list is growing consistently and will soon be made open source for you to add any identifier you want.

### Wallets

As your principal interface for blockchain and web3 interactions, our protocol seamlessly supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) wallets.

If your network requires a different solution, we invite you to contact us. We're eager to collaborate on integrating your native wallet system to expand our interoperability.

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Wallets
EVM wallets serve as indispensable tools for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain as well as other EVM-compatible networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche.

Currently, the protocol supports most EVM wallet providers as per **[Rainbow Kit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)**. To get your first EVM wallet, you can get started here.

Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Wallets
SVM wallets are your gateway to the high-performance world of the Solana blockchain. The protocol currently supports the following providers:

1. Phantom
2. Solflare
3. Torus
4. Ledger
5. Sollet
6. Glow
7. Slope

If you do not have a Solana wallet, check [this](https://phantom.app/learn/guides/how-to-create-a-new-wallet) out.

### Email

No wallet? No worries! You can effortlessly initiate your Gateway ID using any email address you choose. To confirm your ownership, we'll send you a verification code to input.

Similar to wallet-based initialization, a Gateway ID might have already been created on your behalf if an issuer sent a Data Asset to your email address.

You'll gain immediate access once you connect your email and find any associated Data Assets waiting for you. Feel free to expand your account by adding multiple other identifiers as you see fit.

## Upcoming Identifiers

We are looking to actively add Discord, Github, and Twitter to the list. Expect this in the next two months. If you would like to see any other identifiers added, please reach out to us.
