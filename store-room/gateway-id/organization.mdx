To delineate between individual users and collectives, our protocol offers native support for organizations.

While organizations still comply with the fundamental GatewayID elements‚Äîsuch as ID, Username, Signing Key, and Encryption Key‚Äîthe primary distinction lies in the collaborative access it grants.

Multiple users within an organization have the authority to act on behalf of the collective GatewayID, providing a versatile framework for team-based operations and decision-making.

Organizations consist of several users, each with the authority to sign and decrypt on the organization's behalf. Within an organization, there are two distinct roles:

1. Admins
2. Members

<Note>

The pivotal distinction lies in their authority:

Admins can add or remove members, while members can't. However, all users, irrespective of their role, have the privilege to sign and initiate transactions for the organization. A crucial note: Admins don't have the power to remove their fellow admins!

</Note>

Upon establishing an organization, its creator is instantly designated as an admin, empowered to induct other admins and members. It's noteworthy that whenever an organization undertakes a transaction, the specific user who triggers it on the organization's behalf is recorded on Arweave.

<Note>

1. At present, organizations are not equipped to receive PDAs. However, this functionality is on our roadmap and will be integrated into the protocol layer shortly.

2. Stemming from the above limitation, organizations also cannot produce Data Proofs at this time.

## Creating an Organization
