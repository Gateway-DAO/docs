## What is Gateway ID?

Your Universal Passport in a Digital World

Gateway ID is a unified identity hub within the Gateway Protocol, offering a streamlined and secure solution for individual users and organizations. As a main identifier, Gateway ID allows you to aggregate disparate identities from various wallets or web2 platforms into a single, cohesive identity.

This unique identifier becomes the anchor point for associating Private Data Assets (PDAs) with you while safeguarding other sensitive aspects of your identity, such as email addresses and wallet information.

Experience control by selectively adding or removing associated 'identities,' reducing data fragmentation, and streamlining your interactions with multiple wallets and web2 platforms.

This unification empowers you to manage PDAs through a single user-friendly interface. To learn more about the different identities you can aggregate, visit the User Tab here.

Uniquely, Gateway ID removes barriers to entry by allowing instant participation in the network.

Issuers can send PDAs to any supported authentication methods; if an associated Gateway ID doesnâ€™t already exist, one will be automatically initialized for the user.

Our system is ever-evolving, with new authentication methods continually being incorporated. Soon, developers will be free to integrate their preferred authentication systems natively, further broadening the versatility and inclusivity of Gateway ID.
