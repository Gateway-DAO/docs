import gatewayEndpoint from "/snippets/constants.mdx";

Quickest way to start with Gateway Protocol is to use our SDK.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- A package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript

Let's start a new project and install the SDK.

### Make a new project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

```bash
mkdir my-gateway-project
cd my-gateway-project
npm init -y
```

### Install the SDK

Install the SDK using your favorite package manager.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file. This is required to use
  ES6 modules in Node.js.
</Note>

### Get your API key

You will need an API key to use the SDK. You can get it from the [Gateway Protocol dashboard](https://mygateway.xyz/login).

Once you are logged in to the dashboard, navigate to the `Developer Access` section and you can find your API key there.

### Create a new file

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it.

```javascript
import { Gateway, UserIdentifierType } from "@gateway-dao/sdk";

const gateway = new Gateway({
  apiKey: "your-api-key", // Replace with your actual API key from the dashboard
  token: "your-token", // Replace with your Access token from the dashboard
  url: "https://protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql", // Pointing to testnet
});

async function main() {
  try {
    let obj = {
      dataModelId: "9f27397e-27f2-4c30-b1b7-829371de4df5", // Replace with the data model id you want to use
      description: "Description of the PDA",
      title: "Favorite Person on Crypto Twitter",
      claim: {
        handleName: "@gateway_xyz",
        favoritePosts: ["awesome"],
      },
      owner: {
        type: UserIdentifierType.GATEWAY_ID, // can be issued to EVM and Solana addresses as well
        value: "saviour1001", // whom you want to issue the PDA to
      },
    };
    const { createPDA } = await gateway.pda.createPDA(obj);

    console.log(createPDA);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error); // Can log it for debugging
  }
}

main();
```

Replace `your-api-key` and `your-token` with your actual API key and token.

### Run the code

Run the code using your favorite JavaScript runtime.

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the output of the `createPDA` mutation in the console.

That's it! You have successfully created a new PDA using the Gateway Protocol SDK.
