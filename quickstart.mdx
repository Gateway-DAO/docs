Quickest way to start with Gateway Protocol is to use our SDK.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18
- A package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript

Let's start a new project and install the SDK.

### Make a new project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

```bash
mkdir my-gateway-project
cd my-gateway-project
npm init -y
```

### Install the SDK

Install the SDK using your favorite package manager.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file. This is required to use
  ES6 modules in Node.js.
</Note>

### Get your API key

You will need an API key to use the SDK. You can get it from the [Gateway Protocol dashboard](https://gateway.tech/login).

For the testnet version you would have to create an Organization, which can be done from the dashboard. Just click on your profile on the bottom left corner and click on `Create Organization`.

Once you have created an organization, your `Developer Access` section will be unlocked.

If you are just playing around with the SDK, you can use the [Sandbox version](https://sandbox.gateway.tech/dashboard) which doesn't need creating an organization.

Once you are logged in to the dashboard, navigate to the `Developer Access` section and you can find your API key there.

### Create a new file

Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it.

```javascript
import {
  Gateway,
  UserIdentifierType,
  OrganizationIdentifierType,
} from "@gateway-dao/sdk";

const gateway = new Gateway({
  apiKey: "your-api-key", // Replace with your actual API key from the dashboard
  token: "your-token", // Replace with your Access token from the dashboard
  url: "https://protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql", // Pointing to testnet
});

async function main() {
  try {
    let obj = {
      dataModelId: "7f1e400e-b761-4e35-913d-09e500f36e79",
      description: "TESTING MODEL",
      title: "TESTING MODEL",
      claim: {
        model_id: "123",
      },
      owner: {
        type: UserIdentifierType.GATEWAY_ID,
        value: "YOUR_GATEWAY_ID",
      },
      organization: {
        type: OrganizationIdentifierType.GATEWAY_ID,
        value: "YOUR_ORG_ID",
      },
    };
    const { createPDA } = await gateway.pda.createPDA(obj);
    console.log(createPDA);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error); // Can log it for debugging
  }
}

main();
```

Replace `your-api-key` and `your-token` with your actual API key and token.

### Run the code

Run the code using your favorite JavaScript runtime.

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the output of the `createPDA` mutation in the console.

That's it! You have successfully created a new PDA using the Gateway Protocol SDK.
