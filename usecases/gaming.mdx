### Gamer Reputation: Loadingâ€¦

Gamers who grew up on Xbox, Playstation, or steam are well aware of gamercard and scoring systems. Gamers earn points towards their profile based on achievements earned in single player games, challenges completed in online PVPs, and participating in tournaments.

However, reputation is often siloed to individual gaming ecosystems or platforms. The fragmentation across the gaming ecosystem limits the objective usage of reputation to enable unique experiences like early access, exclusive invites, and in-game rewards.

### The Gateway to Gaming Across Platforms

Gateway addresses the challenge of secure and verifiable reputations between ecosystems by empowering platforms to contribute data to our protocol, which is managed by a singular DID. This allows users logins like Xbox Gamertag or Playstation ID to be a receiving method for data assets, while the GatewayDID is how users will be recognized at the protocol level.

Through Gateway, gamers can grant permission for their reputations to be shared with other platforms, communities, or games in a manner that is secure, transparent, and under their control. This seamless sharing mechanism not only enhances trust among players and platforms but also paves the way for a more interconnected gaming universe.

### **Access and Perks Based on Reputation**

Gateway's innovative approach opens up new avenues for recognizing and rewarding player reputation. Gamers with high reputation scores or specific achievements could gain access to exclusive content, early releases, special events, and other perks. Since Gateway ensures the authenticity and integrity of data contributors, data requests, and proofs; platforms and developers can confidently offer rewards based on these metrics.

Fostering a meritocratic environment where dedication and positive behavior are tangibly recognized.
