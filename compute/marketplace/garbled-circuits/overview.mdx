Gateway implements garbled circuits as its core cryptographic primitive for encrypted computation. This implementation enables privacy-preserving computations through a novel architecture that combines the efficiency of boolean circuits with strong security guarantees.

## What are Garbled Circuits?

Garbled circuits are a cryptographic technique that enables secure computation between multiple parties by allowing them to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. They work by converting computational operations into boolean circuits where the inputs are "garbled" (encrypted) while still allowing computation. This enables:

- Private computation on encrypted data
- Efficient parallel processing
- Verifiable results
- Deterministic operations

## The Gateway Virtual Machine (GVM)

The Gateway Virtual Machine (GVM) is our specialized runtime for processing garbled circuits. It manages the entire lifecycle of secure computations:

1. **Input Processing**: Handles and verifies garbled inputs
2. **Computation**: Executes programs on encrypted data
3. **Output Delivery**: Returns encrypted results to authorized parties

### Key Features

- **Turing Completeness**: Can compute any algorithm, providing unlimited computational flexibility
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Performs calculations on encrypted data without requiring decryption
- **Deterministic Execution**: Given the same inputs, circuits always produce identical outputs

## Why Garbled Circuits?

Gateway chose garbled circuits for several compelling reasons:

1. **Efficiency**

   - Lower hardware requirements compared to linear secret sharing schemes
   - Faster execution than fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for arithmetic and boolean operations
   - No bootstrapping overhead

2. **Maturity**

   - Extensive research history
   - Well-optimized techniques
   - Proven security properties

3. **Flexibility**
   - Cost-effective for complex functions
   - Scalable for larger operations
   - Efficient parallel processing capabilities

## Comparison with FHE

| Feature        | Garbled Circuits                                                                 | FHE                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strengths**  | **Efficiency**: More efficient for complex functions, circuit size defines cost. | **Flexibility**: Arbitrary computations on encrypted data.           |
|                | **Established Research**: Optimized techniques like TinyOT.                      | **Non-Interactivity**: Less interaction after initial data transfer. |
|                | **Security Against Malicious Adversaries**: Authenticated garbled circuits.      |                                                                      |
| **Weaknesses** | **Circuit Dependency**: Predefined circuit needed.                               | **Efficiency**: Computationally intensive, noise accumulation.       |
|                | **Interactivity**: Multiple rounds of interaction can impact performance.        | **Noise Accumulation**: Can lead to decryption failures.             |

## Technical Implementation

Gateway's implementation is based on the research paper ["Authenticated Garbling and Efficient Maliciously Secure Two-Party Computation" by Wang, Ranellucci, and Katz](https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p21-wangA.pdf), and leverages the [Tandem Project](https://github.com/sine-fdn/tandem) by Sine Foundation as its underlying engine.

### Key Features of the Authenticated Garbled Circuit Scheme

The Gateway Virtual Machine (GVM) implements authenticated garbled circuits with several key features:

1. **Verifiable Computation**

   - Intrinsic verification of inputs and outputs
   - No requirement for external SNARKs or proof systems
   - Built-in correctness guarantees

2. **Security Guarantees**

   - Complete confidentiality throughout computation
   - Input and output privacy
   - Protection of intermediate states
   - Only authorized computations permitted

3. **Efficient Processing**
   - Verification integrated into circuit operations
   - Minimized overhead from proof systems
   - Optimized for performance

## Security Properties
