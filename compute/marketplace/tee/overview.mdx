Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are secure, isolated environments that run on hardware-level separation from the main operating system. Gateway's platform leverages TEEs to enable privacy-preserving computation, particularly for AI workloads that require both high performance and strong security guarantees.

### Supported Platforms

Gateway's TEE implementation currently supports:

- AWS Nitro Enclaves (Primary)
- Intel SGX (Planned - Q1 2025)
- AMD EPYC SEV (Planned - Q1 2025)

## Use Cases

### AI Model Privacy

1. **Private Inference**

   - Run proprietary AI models in isolated environments
   - Process sensitive user data without exposure
   - Ensure model weights remain confidential
   - Enable secure API access to model capabilities

2. **Secure Training**
   - Train models on sensitive datasets
   - Federated learning coordination
   - Multi-party computation for model updates
   - Privacy-preserving gradient aggregation

### Data Processing

1. **Sensitive Data Analytics**

   - Process PII and regulated data
   - Perform computations on encrypted data
   - Generate aggregated insights
   - Maintain data sovereignty

2. **Multi-party Computation**
   - Secure data sharing between organizations
   - Joint analytics on combined datasets
   - Privacy-preserving data marketplaces
   - Regulatory compliance workflows

## Implementation Guide

### Security Considerations

1. **Attestation Requirements**

   - Verify enclave measurements
   - Validate platform certificates
   - Check security version numbers
   - Implement nonce-based freshness

2. **Network Security**
   - TLS termination inside enclave
   - Certificate management
   - Network isolation policies
   - Secure packet forwarding

### Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**

   - Appropriate memory allocation
   - CPU core assignment
   - Network bandwidth allocation
   - Storage access patterns

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation
   - Secure error messages
   - State recovery
   - Audit logging

## Future Roadmap

1. **Platform Support**

   - Intel SGX integration
   - AMD EPYC SEV support
   - Multi-platform orchestration
   - Cross-platform attestation

2. **SDK Integration**

   - Native TEE support in SDKs
   - Simplified deployment APIs
   - Attestation verification helpers
   - Secure state management

3. **Scaling Features**
   - Auto-scaling capabilities
   - Load balancing
   - State synchronization
   - High availability patterns
