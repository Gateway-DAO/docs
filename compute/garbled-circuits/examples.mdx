This page contains practical examples of using Gateway's garbled circuits for privacy-preserving computations. For more examples and the complete source code, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GatewayLabs/gvm/tree/main/compute/examples).

## Core Examples

### 1. Discount Eligibility Check

A simple example demonstrating threshold-based decision making:

```rust
use compute::prelude::*;

#[encrypted(execute)]
fn qualifies_for_discount(purchase_amount: u16) -> bool {
    let DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD = 80;
    purchase_amount >= DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD
}
```

This example shows:

- Basic comparison operations
- Constant value handling
- Boolean return types

### 2. Loan Eligibility Assessment

A complex example showcasing multi-criteria decision making:

```rust
use compute::prelude::*;

#[encrypted(execute)]
fn check_loan_eligibility(credit_score: u16, income: u16, debt_ratio: u16) -> u8 {
    // Define eligibility levels
    let PRIME = 1;
    let SUBPRIME = 2;
    let HIGH_RISK = 3;
    let INELIGIBLE = 0;

    // Nested range checks with if-let expressions
    if let 750..=850 = credit_score {
        if let 50..=200 = income {
            if let 1..=30 = debt_ratio {
                PRIME
            } else {
                HIGH_RISK
            }
        } else {
            SUBPRIME
        }
    } else if let 650..=749 = credit_score {
        if let 35..=199 = income {
            if let 1..=40 = debt_ratio {
                SUBPRIME
            } else {
                HIGH_RISK
            }
        } else {
            HIGH_RISK
        }
    } else if let 300..=649 = credit_score {
        HIGH_RISK
    } else {
        INELIGIBLE
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates:

- Complex conditional logic
- Range-based pattern matching
- Multiple input parameters
- Categorical output encoding

### 3. Access Control System

An example showing role-based access control:

```rust
use compute::prelude::*;

#[encrypted(execute)]
fn access_control(role: u8) -> u8 {
    let SENSITIVE_DATA = 1;
    let PATIENT_NOTES = 2;

    let ADMIN_ROLE = 1;
    let DOCTOR_ROLE = 2;
    let NURSE_ROLE = 3;

    match role {
        ADMIN_ROLE => SENSITIVE_DATA,
        DOCTOR_ROLE => PATIENT_NOTES + SENSITIVE_DATA,
        NURSE_ROLE => PATIENT_NOTES,
        _ => 0
    }
}
```

This example illustrates:

- Match expressions
- Role-based authorization
- Bitwise operations for permission flags

## Key Patterns

### Pattern 1: Range-Based Logic

```rust
if let 1..=100 = value {
    // Value is within acceptable range
    perform_operation(value)
} else {
    // Value is outside range
    handle_error()
}
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Level Decision Trees

```rust
match value {
    0 => BASE_LEVEL,
    1..=5 => INTERMEDIATE_LEVEL,
    6..10 => ADVANCED_LEVEL,
    _ => ERROR_LEVEL,
}
```

### Pattern 3: Composite Conditions

```rust
if condition_a && condition_b {
    // Both conditions must be true
    POSITIVE_RESULT
} else {
    NEGATIVE_RESULT
}
```

## Testing Examples

Each example can be tested using the provided main function:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Test case for loan eligibility
    let credit_score = 780_u16;
    let income = 75_u16;
    let debt_ratio = 25_u16;

    let eligibility = check_loan_eligibility(credit_score, income, debt_ratio);
    println!("Eligibility Level: {}", eligibility);
}
```

Remember that these examples are running in a secure, encrypted environment where all computations maintain data privacy throughout the execution.

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Clear Constants

- Define constants at the beginning of functions
- Use descriptive names for better readability

### 2. Range Validation

- Use if-let with ranges for input validation
- Handle out-of-range cases explicitly

### 3. Error Handling

- Always provide default/error cases
- Use clear error codes or flags

### 4. Code Organization

- Structured decision trees
- Clear separation of logic levels
