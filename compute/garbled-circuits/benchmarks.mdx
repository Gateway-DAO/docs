This benchmark suite compares the performance of Gateway's garbled circuits implementation against TFHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) for fundamental operations. All tests were performed using 128-bit integers to provide a comprehensive view of performance characteristics in privacy-preserving computation.

## Performance Overview

Gateway consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to TFHE, with most operations completing in milliseconds rather than seconds. This performance difference makes Gateway particularly suitable for:

- Real-time applications
- High-throughput environments
- Performance-sensitive operations
- Complex computational workflows
