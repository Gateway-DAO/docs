## What is a Verifier?

Verifiers function as data consumers within the network, requesting and receiving information from users. The limitation of data consumed is only bound to the scope of contributions flowing into the network. Upon receipt of such data, verifiers transition into a critical role as data controllers, tasked with the ethical and transparent management of this information. Their stewardship over data not only underscores their commitment to ethical standards but also reinforces the clarity and integrity of data utilization within the ecosystem.


## Why be a Verifier?

1. **Deepen User Insights**: Enhance your understanding and gain richer context about your users.
2. **Unlock Invaluable Data**: Access information previously out of reach, propelling your strategy forward.
3. **Forge Data Partnerships**: Establish beneficial collaborations through streamlined data sharing.
4. **Minimize Liability**: Reduce risks by limiting your direct handling and storage of sensitive personal information (PII).
5. **Diverse Applications**: The possibilities are vast, from verifying identity components to offering targeted promotions.

Ultimately, each verifier possesses unique objectives and requirements. The data they seek provides diverse advantages, whether it's for gaining deeper insights, ensuring authenticity, or crafting specialized offers.

## FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who can be a verifer/consume data?">
    Similar to issuers, anyone can be a verifier. We anticipate that primary verifiers will be applications and websites that require information from their user base.

  <Accordion title="What is the issuer responsible/liable for?">
1. Issuers bear the responsibility for maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the data they provide. Continual submission of erroneous information can erode trust among verifiers in the network, leading to decreased consumption of your data.
2. Issuers are encouraged to actively promote and highlight their participation in the network, informing partners and others about their conrtibuted data. By doing so, they can spur verification of their information. Gateway is here to help amplify this message via our Twitter, Docs, and Discord channels. If you're interested in maximizing your visibility, please reach out to us at **[support@mygateway.xyz](mailto:support@mygateway.xyz)**.
3. Issuers hold the responsibility of informing their users when PDAs have been issued, transferring custody of the information to them. To streamline this process, Gateway offers assistance via the packaged integrations like the [widget]() and also allows to send notification emails to the recipients of the data.
