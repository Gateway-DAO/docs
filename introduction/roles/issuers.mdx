## What is an Issuer?
Issuers serve as the contributing party in the protocol, acting as the primary contributors of user-generated data through their own platforms. By contributing data, they aim not only to enhance interoperability within their partner ecosystem but also to empower their user community. The onus of maintaining data integrity rests with the issuers, who play a crucial role in setting the gold standard for data submission across the network. Leading issuers can significantly influence data standardization, thereby fortifying the overall robustness and reliability of the network.

## Why Be an Issuer?

1. **Issuers Benefit Financially**: Every time data is used, issuers earn a fee, creating a lucrative revenue stream.
2. **User-Centric Custody**: Issuers transfer data custody to users, thereby mitigating their own risks related to data liability and sharing concerns.
3. **Streamlined Compliance**: By relinquishing authority over data permissioning to the recipient, issuers can significantly reduce compliance challenges and associated costs.
4. **Enhanced Brand Visibility**: Issuers gain increased brand recognition as their data become more frequently used.
5. **Leveraged Distribution**: Issuers can capitalize on the protocol's existing distribution network, minimizing the need for outreach and bespoke integration efforts.
