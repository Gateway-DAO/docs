## What is an Issuer?
Issuers serve as the contributing party in the protocol, acting as the primary contributors of user-generated data through their own platforms. By contributing data, they aim not only to enhance interoperability within their partner ecosystem but also to empower their user community. The onus of maintaining data integrity rests with the issuers, who play a crucial role in setting the gold standard for data submission across the network. Leading issuers can significantly influence data standardization, thereby fortifying the overall robustness and reliability of the network.

## Why Be an Issuer?

1. **Issuers Benefit Financially**: Every time data is used, issuers earn a fee, creating a lucrative revenue stream.
2. **User-Centric Custody**: Issuers transfer data custody to users, thereby mitigating their own risks related to data liability and sharing concerns.
3. **Streamlined Compliance**: By relinquishing authority over data permissioning to the recipient, issuers can significantly reduce compliance challenges and associated costs.
4. **Enhanced Brand Visibility**: Issuers gain increased brand recognition as their data become more frequently used.
5. **Leveraged Distribution**: Issuers can capitalize on the protocol's existing distribution network, minimizing the need for outreach and bespoke integration efforts.

  <Accordion title="What information should I contribute?">

When determining what information to contribute to the protocol, issuers are encouraged to strike a balance among various factors. Here are some pivotal considerations to guide your decision-making:

1. Reflect on the data you currently catalog and manage.
2. Identify which pieces of information would enhance the verification processes for other network partners.
3. Recognize and segregate information you'd prefer not to retain, reducing potential liabilities.

By weighing these elements, issuers can optimize their contributions for mutual benefit within the protocol.

For non-orgs, you can make attestations to your peers directly from [here](mygateway.xyz).

  <Accordion title="What is the issuer responsible/liable for?">
1. Issuers bear the responsibility for maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the data they provide. Continual submission of erroneous information can erode trust among verifiers in the network, leading to decreased consumption of your data.
2. Issuers are encouraged to actively promote and highlight their participation in the network, informing partners and others about their conrtibuted data. By doing so, they can spur verification of their information. Gateway is here to help amplify this message via our Twitter, Docs, and Discord channels. If you're interested in maximizing your visibility, please reach out to us at **[support@mygateway.xyz](mailto:support@mygateway.xyz)**.
3. Issuers hold the responsibility of informing their users when PDAs have been issued, transferring custody of the information to them. To streamline this process, Gateway offers assistance via the packaged integrations like the [widget]() and also allows to send notification emails to the recipients of the data.
