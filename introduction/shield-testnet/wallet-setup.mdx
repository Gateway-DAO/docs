title: Wallet Setup
---

You need to have a wallet to interact with dApps on the Gateway Shield testnet. Our testnet is compatible with any EVM-compatible wallets: Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Trust, Phantom or any wallet that has WalletConnect support.

## Metamask

To install Metamask, please visit their [official website](https://metamask.io/download/).

To import Gateway Shield Testnet to your Metamask wallet, you can visit our [testnet faucet portal](https://faucet.gateway.tech/), then click the "Add Network to Wallet" link. This will then prompt Metamask extension/application, asking you to connect your wallet. After, it will import the chain ID, RPC URL and Block Explorer URL to your Metamask. You can now use the testnet on your Metamask.

## Manual network configuration

Some wallets won't work with the "Add Network to Wallet" link. If that is the case, you can add the network manually by inserting the configuration details from the table below:
