# Blockchain's Biggest Problem

Blockchains can only process public information—a fundamental limitation that prevents them from becoming a universal computing platform. This limitation isn't just a technical constraint—it's the key reason why many practical applications haven't moved or been built on-chain. In order to build end to end applications on-chain, developers need infrastructure that allows them to handle ANY type of data and logic, whether it be sensitive, high value, personal, business secrets, or proprietary. We believe by unlocking this encrypted state as a native primitive, we're pioneering the era of unified blockchains.



## What is Encrypted State?

Encrypted state means computation and storage of data that remains encrypted on-chain, yet can still be verifiably correct. True universal computation requires both public and encrypted state, enabling any type of computation to run on-chain.



Just like HTTPS did for the internet, encrypted state transforms blockchain from "everything public" to "selectively private". As a developer, this means you can **build full stack applications leveraging any logic or data with all the properties and guarantees of a blockchain.**



# **Introducing Gateway**

Gateway is a Ethereum - compatible Layer &#x31;**.** Gateway introduces the Gateway Virtual Machine (GVM) which seamlessly handles both plaintext and encrypted state. This means developers can write standard Solidity contracts while gaining native access to encrypted state. By maintaining full EVM compatibility, the GVM allows developers to leverage their existing skills and tools.
