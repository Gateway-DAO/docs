# Blockchain's Biggest Problem

Blockchains can only process public information—a fundamental limitation that prevents them from becoming a universal computing platform. This limitation isn't just a technical constraint—it's the key reason why many practical applications haven't moved or been built on-chain. In order to build end to end applications on-chain, developers need infrastructure that allows them to handle ANY type of data and logic, whether it be sensitive, high value, personal, business secrets, or proprietary. We believe by unlocking this encrypted state as a native primitive, we're pioneering the era of unified blockchains.



## What is Encrypted State?



Encrypted state means computation and storage of data that remains encrypted on-chain, yet can still be verifiably correct. True universal computation requires both public and encrypted state, enabling any type of computation to run on-chain.
