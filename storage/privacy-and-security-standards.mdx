Data Sensitivity is a paramount concern, which is why Gateway is built from the ground up to ensure that only authorized parties have access to data assets only when that permission has been granted by the data owner.

## Encryption Practices

By utilizing symmetric encryption, sensitive data is encoded such that it can only be decoded only with the corresponding key.

To elevate the security measures even further, this symetric key itself is enrypted using a users unique, personal encryption key. The result of which vends a unique symmetric key for each Data Asset.

This dual layer encryption ensures that only the Data Owner has the capability to access and decrypt the Data Asset.

> Put simply, the result is encrypted Data which can only be accessed with an encrypted key.

This methodology adheres to advanced security protocols and provides an added layer of assurance that your private information remains confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized parties.

## Storage

Gateway uses Encrypted Data Vaults ("EDVs") to to securely house the encrypted Data Assets stored on the Network.

EDVs are the primary entities responsible for storing and maintaining encrypted data, allowing for efficient data management without overburdening the main network.

EDVs have various storage metrics, including capacity, total staked capacity, free capacity, purchased capacity, and used storage. Upon registration, an EDV broadcasts its total storage capacity to the validators and stakes a sufficient quantity of tokens to commence network services. EDVs pledge available storage at the beginning of each epoch and are bound by the protocol to fulfill their storage agreements.
