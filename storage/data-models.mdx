## What is a Data Model?

```

TODO -

- benefits of using a model
   - verification
   - composability in compute


```

Data Models serve as a structured, foundational template for [Data Assets](/core-concepts/data-assets) added to the Gateway Network and establish a standardized set of fields, metadata, and other attributes to make Developers' lives easier.

> Data Models are the "blueprints" for data objects stored to the Gateway Network

A predictable data structure speeds up development and increases composability.

## How it Works

![Data Model Examples](/assets/core-concepts/dataModelsExamples.png)

Data Models define what data is available on the network. Contributors input data into the network by following the Data Model of choice.

```

TODO - not correct, need to get this point across :point-down:

Therefore, all Data Assets are tied to a unique Data Model.

Therefore, all Data Assets _can be_ tied to a unique Data Model.

![Data Model Structure](/assets/core-concepts/dataModelStructure.png)

### Name

This helps educate issuers on what the Data Model is generally intended for.

### Creation Date

The date the Data Model was created

### Last Updated

Indicates when the Data Model was edited last

### Data Model ID

Each Data Model has a unique identifier (UUID)

### Schema

These are the field names that create the claim. Every Data Asset issued using this Data Model will have this claim structure.
