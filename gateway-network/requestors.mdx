## What is a Requestor?

Requestors function as data consumers within the network, requesting and receiving information from users.

The limitation of data consumed is only bound to the scope of contributions flowing into the network. Upon receipt of such data, requestors transition into a critical role as data controllers, tasked with the ethical and transparent management of this information.

Their stewardship over data not only underscores their commitment to ethical standards but also reinforces the clarity and integrity of data utilization within the ecosystem.

## Why be a Requestor?

1. **Deepen User Insights**: Enhance your understanding and gain richer context about your users.
2. **Unlock Invaluable Data**: Access information previously out of reach, propelling your strategy forward.
3. **Forge Data Partnerships**: Establish beneficial collaborations through streamlined data sharing.
4. **Minimize Liability**: Reduce risks by limiting your direct handling and storage of sensitive personal information (PII).
5. **Diverse Applications**: The possibilities are vast, from verifying identity components to offering targeted promotions.

Ultimately, each requestor possesses unique objectives and requirements. The data they seek provides diverse advantages, whether it's for gaining deeper insights, ensuring authenticity, or crafting specialized offers.

## How to be a Requestor?

1. **Data Request Templates** - Use an Existing Template or Craft Your Own!

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who can be a requestor/consume data?">
    Similar to issuers, anyone can be a requestor. We anticipate that primary requestors will be applications and websites that require information from their user base.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What information should I verify?">

Determine the most pertinent information for your needs by delving into the <a href= {gatewayExplorerURL} target="_blank">Gateway Explorer </a> . See firsthand twhat information is being contributed inside the network, allowing you to understand what data you can request and use.

<Accordion title="What is the issuer responsible/liable for?">
  **Guardians of User Data**: As receivers of user-identifiable information,
  requestors bear the responsibility of ensuring this data remains secure and
  untouched by malintent. Forwarding this information to unauthorized third
  parties is strictly off-bounds. **Transparent Communication**: It's a
  requestor's duty to be forthright about their intentions. When requesting
  data, they must clearly articulate its intended use, as highlighted in the
  'data use' section during the request initiation.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I verify data directly through the protocol?">
    
    You can utilize the API/SDK [here](../../introduction#start-building) to request data directly from the protocol. This offers the most flexibility in terms of customization of data usage.
