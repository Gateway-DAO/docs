## What is the Owner?

Owners represent the individual nodes within the protocol, serving as both controllers and custodians of their personal information.

As sovereign guardians of their data, they hold the exclusive right to selectively distribute and grant access to verifiers within the network. This data, manifested in the form of Personal Data Assets (PDAs), is sourced from issuers.

Owners embody the empowerment of data autonomy, ensuring that the sharing of their information is a deliberate and controlled process, in alignment with the principles of data privacy and ownership. Their role is fundamental in maintaining the integrity and consent-driven exchange of information within the network.

## What do Owners do?

1. Owners have the capability to **share static snapshots of their data**, known as Data Proofs, with other parties. These static snapshots are information that is accessible
2. Owners have the ability to **manage data requests from Verifiers**. Upon acceptance, a Data Proof is automatically produced.
3. Owners **retain the right to withdraw access to their proofs** and data for specific verifiers at any time they deem fit.

### Why is This Important?

By becoming custodians of their data, all data can become **zero-party data**.
