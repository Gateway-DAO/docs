## What is a Data Contributor?

Data Contributors ("Contributors") are the primary source of the data on the Gateway Network.

Contributors are able to enhance interoperability within their own developer ecosystem while ensuring their user community retains complete control to the access of their user data.

The responsibility of maintaining data integrity rests with the Contributors, who play a crucial role in setting the gold standard for data submission across the Gateway Network.

Leading Contributors can significantly influence data standardization, thereby fortifying the overall robustness and reliability of the Gateway Network.

## Benefits of becoming a Contributor?

```
TODO - all of this is correct but need to add lines about how being a contributor gives possbility to easily intergrate with compute network

Use a [Data Model](/core-concepts/data-models) to help tell structure of data to know what to do and how to compute on that data,

models useful for verification


```

1. **Contributor Rewards**: Contributors accrue a reward every time data is used, creating a lucrative revenue streams.
2. **Leverage Encrypted Compute**: Contributors are able to set standards for Data Models and Data Assets
3. **User-Centric Custody**: Contributors transfer data custody to users, thereby mitigating their own risks related to data liability and sharing concerns.
4. **Streamlined Compliance**: By relinquishing authority over data permissions to the recipient, Contributors can significantly reduce compliance challenges and associated costs.
5. **Enhanced Brand Visibility**: Contributors gain increased brand recognition as their data become more frequently used.
6. **Leveraged Distribution**: Contributors can capitalize on the Gateway Networks's existing distribution network, minimizing the need for outreach and bespoke integration efforts.

So you're interested in becoming an contributor? Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Login to Gateway Dashboard**: Visit [gateway.tech](https://gateway.tech) and sign in.
2. **Selecting a Data Model or Creating Your Own**: Choose from a list of existing data models or create your own. Data models are the templates for the data you want to contribute.
3. **Issuing Data Assets**: Once you've selected a data model, you can start issuing Data Assets. Data Assets are the actual data you want to contribute. You can contribute Data Assets to your users or to other entities in the network.
4. **Updating and Revoking Data Assets**: Contributors can update or revoke Data Assets at any time. This is useful when the data changes or when you want to stop sharing the data with a particular entity.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who can contribute data?">
    Gateway democratizes the role of the contributor, welcoming entities of all sizesâ€”from large-scale organizations with over 100,000 employees to individual users with just an internet connection.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What information should I contribute?">

When determining what information to contribute to the protocol, contributors are encouraged to strike a balance among various factors. Here are some pivotal considerations to guide your decision-making:

1. Reflect on the data you currently catalog and manage.
2. Identify which pieces of information would enhance the verification processes for other network partners.
3. Recognize and segregate information you'd prefer not to retain, reducing potential liabilities.

By weighing these elements, contributors can optimize their contributions for mutual benefit within the protocol.

For non-orgs, you can make attestations to your peers directly from [here](https://www.gateway.tech/).

<Accordion title="What is the contributor responsible/liable for?">
  1. Contributors bear the responsibility for maintaining the accuracy and
  integrity of the data they provide. Continual submission of erroneous
  information can erode trust among verifiers in the network, leading to
  decreased consumption of your data. 2. Contributors are encouraged to actively
  promote and highlight their participation in the network, informing partners
  and others about their contributed data. By doing so, they can spur
  verification of their information. Gateway is here to help amplify this
  message via our Twitter, Docs, and Discord channels. If you're interested in
  maximizing your visibility, please reach out to us at
  **[support@mygateway.xyz](mailto:support@mygateway.xyz)**. 3. Contributors
  hold the responsibility of informing their users when Data Assets have been
  contributed, transferring custody of the information to them. To streamline
  this process, Gateway offers assistance via the packaged integrations like the
  widget and also allows to send notification emails to the recipients of the
  data.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I contributor data directly through the protocol?">

    You can utilize the API/SDK [here](/developer-guide/sdk/introduction) to contributor directly into the protocol. This offers the most flexibility in terms of customization of data contribution.
