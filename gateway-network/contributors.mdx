## What is an Contributor?

Contributors serve as the contributing party in the protocol, acting as the primary contributors of user-generated data through their own platforms.

By contributing data, they aim not only to enhance interoperability within their partner ecosystem but also to empower their user community. The responsibility of **maintaining data integrity** rests with the contributors, who play a crucial role in setting the gold standard for data submission across the network.

Leading contributors can significantly influence data standardization, thereby fortifying the overall robustness and reliability of the network.

## Why be a Contributor?

1. **Contributors Benefit Financially**: Every time data is used, contributors earn a fee, creating a lucrative revenue stream.
2. **User-Centric Custody**: Contributors transfer data custody to users, thereby mitigating their own risks related to data liability and sharing concerns.
3. **Streamlined Compliance**: By relinquishing authority over data permissioning to the recipient, contributors can significantly reduce compliance challenges and associated costs.
4. **Enhanced Brand Visibility**: Contributors gain increased brand recognition as their data become more frequently used.
5. **Leveraged Distribution**: Contributors can capitalize on the protocol's existing distribution network, minimizing the need for outreach and bespoke integration efforts.

Contributors are paid every time a PDA they contributed is used in a Data Proof (was consumed by a verifier). The amount you are paid depends on the data model you contributed the PDA from.

## How to be an Contributor ?

So you're interested in becoming an contributor? Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Login to Gateway Dashboard**: Visit [mygateway.xyz](https://mygateway.xyz) and sign in.
2. **Selecting a Data Model or Creating Your Own**: Choose from a list of existing data models or create your own. Data models are the templates for the data you want to contribute.
3. **Issuing Personal Data Assets(PDAs)**: Once you've selected a data model, you can start issuing PDAs. PDAs are the actual data you want to contribute. You can contribute PDAs to your users or to other entities in the network.
4. **Updating and Revoking PDAs**: Contributors can update or revoke PDAs at any time. This is useful when the data changes or when you want to stop sharing the data with a particular entity.

  <Accordion title="What information should I contribute?">

When determining what information to contribute to the protocol, contributors are encouraged to strike a balance among various factors. Here are some pivotal considerations to guide your decision-making:

1. Reflect on the data you currently catalog and manage.
2. Identify which pieces of information would enhance the verification processes for other network partners.
3. Recognize and segregate information you'd prefer not to retain, reducing potential liabilities.

By weighing these elements, contributors can optimize their contributions for mutual benefit within the protocol.

For non-orgs, you can make attestations to your peers directly from [here](https://www.mygateway.xyz/).

<Accordion title="What is the contributor responsible/liable for?">
  1. Contributors bear the responsibility for maintaining the accuracy and
  integrity of the data they provide. Continual submission of erroneous
  information can erode trust among verifiers in the network, leading to
  decreased consumption of your data. 2. Contributors are encouraged to actively
  promote and highlight their participation in the network, informing partners
  and others about their conrtibuted data. By doing so, they can spur
  verification of their information. Gateway is here to help amplify this
  message via our Twitter, Docs, and Discord channels. If you're interested in
  maximizing your visibility, please reach out to us at
  **[support@mygateway.xyz](mailto:support@mygateway.xyz)**. 3. Contributors
  hold the responsibility of informing their users when PDAs have been
  contributed, transferring custody of the information to them. To streamline
  this process, Gateway offers assistance via the packaged integrations like the
  [widget](/widget/introduction) and also allows to send notification emails to
  the recipients of the data.

  <Accordion title="How can I contributor data directly through the protocol?">
    
    You can utilize the API/SDK [here](/developer-guide/sdk/introduction) to contributor directly into the protocol. This offers the most flexibility in terms of customization of data contribution.
