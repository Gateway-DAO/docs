In this JavaScript quickstart we will learn how to:

- Install the Gateway SDK
- Creating a Gateway Client
- Interacting with the Protocol for various operations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install @gateway-dao/sdk">

First begin by installing the `@gateway-dao/sdk` package.

<CodeGroup>

```bash bun
bun add @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash npm
npm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @gateway-dao/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @gateway-dao/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Setup the Gateway Client" >

You will need an API Key and Bearer token to authenticate with the Gateway Protocol.
You can obtain these from the [Gateway Dashboard](https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/dashboard/).

To setup the gateway client we will authenticate with a bearer-token and a Api key as follows:

```ts Node.js
import { Gateway } from "@gateway-dao/sdk";

const gateway = new Gateway({
  apiKey: "your-api-key", // Replace with your API Key
  token: "your-token", // Replace with your Bearer Token
  url: "",
});
```

<Warning>
  Make sure you add token without "Bearer" word as we add Bearer automatically
  when you make request. Else it will give you Unauthorized error even if your
  token is correct.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Do not share your authentication token with people you donâ€™t trust. This gives
  the user control over your account and they will be able to manage PDAs (and
  more) with it. Use environment variables to keep it safe.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Interacting with the Gateway Protocol" >

Now that we have setup the Gateway Client, we can interact with the Gateway Protocol for various operations.

## Create a PDA

```ts Node.js
import { Gateway, UserIdentifierType } from "@gateway-dao/sdk";

const gateway = new Gateway({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  token: "your-token",
  url: "https://sandbox.protocol.mygateway.xyz/graphql",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    let obj = {
      dataModelId: "uuid-here",
      description: "test",
      title: "test",
      claim: {
        gatewayUse: "test",
      },
      owner: {
        type: UserIdentifierType.GATEWAY_ID,
        value: "test",
      },
    };
    const { createPDA } = await gateway.pda.createPDA(obj);
    console.log(createPDA);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error); // Can log it for debugging
  }
}

main();
```

</Step>

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first PDA and Data Request Template using the Gateway Protocol SDK.
