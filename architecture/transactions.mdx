title: Transactions
---

All events that happen on the protocol are broadcasted on-chain to ensure validation and publically attest consent. The creation of users and organizations is also broadcasted to the chain, allowing the Gateway IDs to be publically verifiable yet privacy-preserving.

The transactions that are broadcasted are the following:

- **Creation of users/organizations:** This anchors the Gateway ID onchain.
- **PDA issuance:** This action anchors and timestamps the creation of a PDA, while broadcasting cryptographic artifacts for PDA validation.
- **PDA status changes:** This anchors any changes in the PDA status, such as when a PDA is revoked.
- **Request creation:** This anchors and timestamps the action of creating a request.
- **Proof creation:** This anchors and timestamps the action of creating a proof. This can be in response to a request, or as an independent sharing action, and it includes cryptographic artifacts for its validation.

## Structure of a transaction

Transactions are currently anchored to Arweave. They include an action, cost, the entities that are a part of it, and metadata to give more context to the action.

On Arweave, the body of a transaction looks like this:

```json
{
  "action": "PDA_ISSUANCE",
  "from": {
    "type": "ORGANIZATION",
    "id": "..."
  },
  "to": {
    "type": "USER",
    "id": "..."
  },
  "cost": {
    "value": "<cost of transaction>",
    "transaction": "<(optional) id of financial fulfillment>"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "issuer": "<id of issuer>",
    "pda": "<id of PDA>",
    "status": "<status of PDA>",
    "signedBy": "<(optional) id of signer>",
    "dataModel": "<id of data model>",
    "expirationDate": "<(optional) expiration date>"
  },
  "_id": "<id of transaction>"
}
```
